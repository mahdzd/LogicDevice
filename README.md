## üìò Overview
This project demonstrates a **Logic-Controlled Board** that uses digital logic design, finite state machines (FSM), and memory elements to dynamically control a set of four colored LEDs (red, green, blue, yellow) using four switches.

The behavior changes based on the last switch turned off, and the mapping between switches and LEDs is retained even when switch caps are physically swapped, creating the illusion of "intelligent" control.

## üîß Features
- **Dynamic LED Control** based on last switch turned off  
- **Locked Mode** for direct mapping  
- **Capless Switch Trick** to deactivate switches  
- **7-Segment Display** to indicate mode  
- **Fully implemented FSM, Sequence, and Mapping Units**  
- **Custom 100 kHz Clock using NE555**  
- **RC-based Reset Timer** when all LEDs are off  
- **Breadboard and PCB Implementation**  
- **Soldered Components with Replaceable IC Sockets**
