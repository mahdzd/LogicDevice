## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The Logic-Controlled Board is an interactive switching system featuring four toggle switches and four colored LEDs (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow). Each switch dynamically maps to an LED based on the **last switch turned off**, allowing for an illusion of smart behavior.

Special functionality includes:
- Sequence-dependent LED activation (4 unique sequences)
- Switch caps that disable functionality when removed
- A reset timer
- Optional "practice mode" with a 7-segment display showing the active sequence
- Lock/unlock mode via startup logic

---

## ðŸ”© Features

- âœ… FSM-controlled dynamic switch-LED mapping  
- âœ… 7-segment display mode (practice/performance toggle)  
- âœ… Capless switch detection and timer-based disabling  
- âœ… Sequence memory and reset logic  
- âœ… Clean circuit design with minimal IC usage
